            <div class="aboutcontainer">
                <p>My name is Djeana Carel M. Briones. I was born on May 18, 2005 and I live in Santa Rosa, Laguna. I am currently a sophomore BS Computer Science student at the University of the Philippines Los Banos. I aspire to be a developer that can contribute to the betterment of the country and the society.</p>

                <p>I grew up in Santa Cruz, Marinduque but soon changed our residency when I entered high school. I am the eldest child of my parents, and I only have one sibling. My fascination with technology began when I was in elementary school. Once a month, we are allowed to use the computers in the school to play, and it was a fun experience. It piqued my curiosity about computers and their systems.</p>
                
                <p>At first, I was determined to pursue a career in accountancy due to the influence of my family members who are also BS Accountancy graduates. However, my passion for technology never left me, and I decided to pursue Computer Science in the end.</p>
                
                <p>As of now, I find everything about the program interesting. To others, it may seem boring, but the idea of routine seems like the best choice for me.</p>
                
                <p>I also have other hobbies like crocheting, digital art, reading, or any arts and crafts of sorts. I love to work on my hobbies especially when I’m stressed with schoolworks. I love being able to create something.</p>
                
                <p>I’m looking forward to the next chapters of my life as a Computer Science student. I hope that I can face all challenges with a big smile.</p>
